# Introduction
Supervised machine learning tasks have been extensively studied, and many scalable algorithms have been developed to solve them - e.g. 

* decision trees and their random forest ensembles 
* ensembles of decision trees, developed via gradient boosting mechanism (xgboost, lightgbm)
* neural networks, which are able to extract meaningful features from unstructured data such as media (images, video, audio, text)

While these algorithms vary in their level of complexity and require some expertise to be tuned properly, generally large training datasets and proper cross-validation strategy yield good results.

When properly labelled data is not rich, many learning tasks can benefit from application of unsupervised or semi-supervised learning ideas.

This repository is focused on synthesizing and sharing these ideas, corresponding references and examples of just how this promise can be realized.

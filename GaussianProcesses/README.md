# Learning Gaussian Processes 
This folder is intended to share learning experience of Gaussian processes.

## Reference Materials
Here is a nice introductory [lecture by Andrew Wilson](https://slideshot.epfl.ch/play/k5FuJcUA0L0c) to get you started.

Here is Andrew's [Cornell page](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/andrew/) with many relevant links, including 
* Google Scholar page with Andrew's recent [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=twWX2LIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
* Code used in the papers, sharing Python library designed to leverage [Gaussian Processes as a final layer in Neural Networks via Python API for Keras](https://github.com/alshedivat/keras-gp)
* [Video recordings of several other talks](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/andrew/talks/)
* [Andrew's Ph.D. thesis](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~andrewgw/andrewgwthesis.pdf) on a similar topic

A few papers I started with were:
* (2016 ) [Deep Kernel Learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/wilson16.pdf)
* (2016?) [Spectral Mixture Kernels for Multi-Output Gaussian Processes](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7245-spectral-mixture-kernels-for-multi-output-gaussian-processes.pdf)
* (2017 ) [Learning Scalable Deep Kernels with Recurrent Structure](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-498/16-498.pdf)

## Learning Plan
Purpose: Discover potential of Gaussian Processes to contribute to Machine Learning.

Objectives: 
* Review papers to understand unique values of Gaussian Process, and their recommended applications
* Practice applying Gaussian Processes to various problems 

Initial Questions:

* What is the concept of Gaussian Process?
* What are Gaussian processes best applied to?
* How do Gaussian Processes relate to spectral mixture kernels? What about other kernels? Are there non-kernel versions? 
* How can Gaussian Processes serve naturally as a final layer in Neural Network learning?
*	How does Spectral Mixture representation of covariance matrix help classify and generate Gaussian Processes?
